# Tic-Tac-Toe-console-based-in-C++
Hey there! This is my first solo projectâ€”a Tic-Tac-Toe game built using C++! It's a fun game where two players take turns marking 'X' and 'Y' on a 3x3 grid to win.  

What's Inside:

Easy-to-understand code that runs the game in a console window.
It lets players make moves, checks for valid inputs, and figures out who wins or if it's a draw.
This project is my starting point in learning C++. It shows how I used basic programming ideas like using loops, storing data, and making decisions in code to create a game.

Feel free to take a look, share feedback, or use it to learn C++ and make your own cool games!
